# Test infrastructure as code?

Deep dive into infrastructure as code testing. ARM template, design, development, test and release. How to test your Infrastructure as code implementation with PowerShell using Pester and Azure DevOps.

## Introduction

We are going to look at how cloud automation, infrastructure as code can be structured and used as a software development process.\
Taking a common software development approach we are going to look at each phase and see which tools can be used to accomplish each phase. The ideas are based on the lessons learned of an actual infrastructure as code project.

## Abstract

This session will dive deep into the testing approach of an infrastructure as code project written in PowerShell. We will create a PowerShell module that will allow us to deploy an infrastructure as a service resource using a template. The solution will be fully tested, including unit test of functions, templates, integration and an end to end test.

## Tools

Leveraging tools like Pester, Script Analyzer, Best Practices Checker, Azure DevOps and custom scripts to create a mature and reliable infrastructure as code solution.

## Objectives

At the end of this talk you will be able to:

- create your own test suite for your infrastructure as code project.
- can articulate why infrastructure as code testing is necessary and can increase you quality of delivery.
- get started with your next infrastructure as code project quicker and much more mature.
