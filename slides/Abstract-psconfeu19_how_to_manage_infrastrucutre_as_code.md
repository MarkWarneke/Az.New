# Lessons learned from a large scale infrastructure as code project

Build a solid Infrastructure as code framework using PowerShell, Az Module, Configuration Management, ARM template with Azure DevOps as a collaboration platform fully Unit and Integration tested with Pester.

## Introduction

In the last months a team of consultants have been working on a large scale big data and analytics solution. We implemented infrastructure as code framework to deploy a fully tested solution to any Azure region available with a click of a button. What used to take weeks to build can now be scripted and deployed within hours.

## Abstract

This talk will highlight lessons learned implementing an infrastructure as code project from scratch working with a team. You can expect to learn what challenges to be faced when pursuing a large scale automation project on Azure and which latest technologies the team used to tackle theses challenges.
At the end of the talk you will be able to plan ahead for your Infrastructure as Code Project. You are going to be aware of and can avoid common pitfalls in an automation project. As well as learn how to use a "blue print" templates approach to deploy Azure resources on demand quickly, like Windows and Linux VMs that are fully tested contentiously. Also, you will be aware of what to consider when deploying large scale solutions, that takes nearly half a day to spin up.

## Tools

We will have hands on to Azure DevOps, different Infrastructure as Code tools like PowerShell Az module, ARM templates, Unit and Integration tests with Pester. There is going to be little to no live coding, but a lot of code to show and tools to demonstrate.

## Objectives

- understand and be able to implement the best practices and pit falls the team developed and implemented in the IaC project.
- plan and describe technologies and tools used in the field for development and automated deployments of infrastructure as code resources.
- differentiate the approaches of developing ARM template flavors and when to use them.
